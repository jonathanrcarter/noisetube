NoiseTube is a research project started in 2008 at the Sony Computer Science Laboratory in Paris in collaboration with Vrije Universiteit Brussel.

The goal of the project is to turn smartphones into mobile noise level meters to enable citizens to measure their exposure to noise in their everyday environment and participate in the collective noise mapping of their city or neighborhood.
