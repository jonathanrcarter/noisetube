 * PostProcessor
 * This interface can be used to implement a PostProcessor. The idea behind a PostProcessor is that we create
 * a module which runs over Measurements and checks/adapts them where necessary. This way, when a new Measurement
 * has been added to that queue (on a higher level), the PostProcessor gets this adapted queue and is able to
 * take into account the new Measurement to change the old ones.
